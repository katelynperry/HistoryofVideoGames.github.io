  <h1> History of Video Games</h1>
    <p>Video games are digital games that can be played on a computer device (e.g., tablets, smartphones, laptops, consoles, etc.). <em>Originally</em> designed simply for entertainment, video games have grown into their own industry and field of learning, generating <strong>billions of dollars</strong> each year.</p>

    <h2>The Beginning (1950s)</h2>
    <p>1. Pong</p>
      <p>  Pong was developed in 1958. It is a very simple tennis game. It was developed by Physicist William Higinbotham. It was originally called Tennis for Two. Players are able to turn a knob to adjust the angle of the ball, and push a button to hit the ball towards the other players. When the players press the button when the ball was in their court, in was impossible for a player to miss the ball. If they hit the ball at the wrong time or the wrong angle, the ball wouldn't make it over the net. The first version used in 1958, had an oscilloscope with a tiny display, only five inches in diameter. In 1959, Higinbotham added a new feature that allowed the players to play tennis on the moon, Earth, or Jupiter.

   <p>2. Bertie the Brain
     <p>"Bertie the Brain" was an early computer game built in Toronto, Canada by Josef Kates. It was a signle-player tic-tac-toe game on a PC. The player input was given using a lit keypad and the state of the game displayed on panels lit by light bulbs rather than a conventional screen. An additional light would show whether the player or the AI was on turn. The difficulty of the AI could be adjusted by the operator. </p2>

   <p>3. Mouse in the Maze
      <p>The Mouse in the Maze is played with a light pen. This was the first video game that used a light pen. This game allowed a player to creat a maze by removing line segments on an 8 x 8 grid and place pieces of cheese on the tiles. Then, a virtual mouse will be set free to scurry throughout the maze to search for the cheese. The mouse would run out of energy when searching for the cheese but would also remember the paths it had taken for future attempts adn become more proficient.</p>
