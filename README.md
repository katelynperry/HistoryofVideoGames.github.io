    <h2>The Beginning (1950s)</h2>
    <p>1. Pong</p>
      <p2>  Pong was developed in 1958. It is a very simple tennis game. It was developed by Physicist William Higinbotham. It was originally called Tennis for Two. Players are able to turn a knob to adjust the angle of the ball, and push a button to hit the ball towards the other players. When the players press the button when the ball was in their court, in was impossible for a player to miss the ball. If they hit the ball at the wrong time or the wrong angle, the ball wouldn't make it over the net. The first version used in 1958, had an oscilloscope with a tiny display, only five inches in diameter. In 1959, Higinbotham added a new feature that allowed the players to play tennis on the moon, Earth, or Jupiter.
